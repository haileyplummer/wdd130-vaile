The content I decided to use on my own site plan was determined by my love for secondhand fashion. I have always wanted to showcase the items I am selling while offering a way for a viewer to interact by creating their own outfits before buying. I already had hundreds of photos of my clothing items, so I knew this would come together easily.
I communicated with my developer mainly in-person and a little over text. It was hard at first to know who I needed to connect with, but when we did it went well.
My developer definetly met my expectations. He made sure to ask good questions and to take the extra steps to make my site come to life.
Next time I work with someone I hired to do a project for me, I'll get their contact info sooner so that we can connect outside of class earlier on.
